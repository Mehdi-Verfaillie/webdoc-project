00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.360
This is a film
about one very simple question.

2
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.760
How did we get here?

3
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.720
These are the elements and compounds
from which all humans are made.

4
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.200
They're incredibly,
almost embarrassingly common.

5
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.040
In fact, almost 99% of the human body
is a mixture of air, water,

6
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.960
coal and chalk, with traces of other
slightly more exotic elements

7
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.880
like iron, zinc,
phosphorus and sulphur.

8
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.880
In fact, I've estimated
that the elements

9
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.760
which make up the average
human cost at most a few pounds.

10
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.400
But somehow, trillions of these very
ordinary atoms conspire miraculously

11
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.800
to organise themselves into thinking,
breathing, living human beings.

12
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.680
How the wonders of creation
are assembled from such simple

13
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.600
building blocks, is surely the most
intriguing question we can ask.

14
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.960
You may think that answering it is
beyond the realm of science.

15
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.920
But that's changing.

16
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.680
For the first time, I believe
science has pushed past religion

17
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.880
and philosophy in daring to tackle
this most fundamental of questions.

18
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.640
This film is the story
of a series of bizarre

19
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.960
and interconnected discoveries that
reveal a hidden face of nature.

20
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.320
That woven into its simplest
and most basic laws,

21
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.280
is a power to be unpredictable.

22
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.840
It's about how inanimate matter
with no purpose or design,

23
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.120
can spontaneously
create exquisite beauty.

24
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.240
It's about how the same laws
that make the universe chaotic

25
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.520
and unpredictable, can turn
simple dust into human beings.

26
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.720
It's about the discovery
that there is a strange

27
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.520
and unexpected relationship
between order and chaos.

28
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.480
The natural world really is one
great, blooming, buzzing confusion.

29
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.760
It's a mess of quirky shapes
and blotches.

30
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.720
What patterns there are,
are never quite regular,

31
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.520
and never seem to repeat exactly.

32
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.680
The idea that all this mayhem,
all this chaos, is underpinned,

33
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.720
indeed determined,
by mathematical rules,

34
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.440
and that we can work out what
those rules might be,

35
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.880
runs counter
to our most dearly held intuitions.

36
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.760
So not surprisingly, the first man
to really take on the momentous task

37
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.560
of unravelling
nature's mysterious mathematics,

38
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.000
had a very special and unusual mind.

39
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.520
He was both a great scientist
and a tragic hero.

40
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.040
He was born in 1912, in London.

41
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.920
His name was Alan Turing.

42
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.880
Alan Turing was a remarkable man,

43
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.720
one of the greatest mathematicians
who ever lived.

44
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.560
He discovered many
of the fundamental ideas

45
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.040
that underpin the modern computer.

46
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.120
Also, during the Second World War,

47
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.040
he worked here at Bletchley Park,
just outside today's Milton Keynes,

48
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.800
in what was then a secret
government project called Station X,

49
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.920
which was set up
to crack the German military codes.

50
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.640
The Station X code breakers proved
highly effective,

51
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.720
and Turing's contribution
was crucial.

52
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.560
The work he personally did
to crack German naval codes,

53
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.000
saved thousands of Allied lives
and was a turning point in the war.

54
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.480
But code breaking was just one aspect
of Turing's genius.

55
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.400
Just one part of his
uncanny ability to see patterns

56
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.240
that are hidden from the rest of us.

57
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.840
For Turing, the natural world
offered up the ultimate codes.

58
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.600
And over the course of his life

59
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.160
he'd come tantalisingly
close to cracking them.

60
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.240
Turing was a very original person.

61
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.800
And he had realised that there
was this possibility

62
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.480
that simple mathematical equations

63
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.200
might describe aspects of
the biological world.

64
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.880
And no-one
had thought of that before.

65
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.400
Of all nature's mysteries,
the one that fascinated Turing most

66
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.920
was the idea that there might be
a mathematical basis

67
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.360
to human intelligence.

68
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.480
Turing had very personal
reasons for believing in this.

69
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.880
It was the death of this young
man, Christopher Morcom,

70
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.280
who...Alan Turing, well, he was gay,

71
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.480
and it had been the great emotional
thing of his life at that point.

72
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.600
Christopher Morcom suddenly died.

73
00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.040
And, Alan Turing was obviously
very emotionally disturbed by this.

74
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.160
But you can see
that he wanted to put this

75
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.640
in an intellectual
context, a scientific context.

76
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.240
And the question he wanted
to put into context was

77
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.280
what happens to the mind?
What is it?

78
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.400
Turing became convinced that
mathematics could be used to describe

79
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.120
biological systems,
and ultimately intelligence.

80
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.040
This fascination would give
rise to the modern computer,

81
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.880
and later in Turing's life,
an even more radical idea.

82
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.680
The idea that a simple mathematical
description could be given

83
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.520
for a mysterious process that
takes place in an embryo.

84
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.720
The process is called morphogenesis,
and it's very puzzling.

85
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.440
At first, all the cells in
the embryo are identical.

86
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.040
Then, as this footage of a
fish embryo shows,

87
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.600
the cells begin to clump together,

88
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.560
and also become
different from each other.

89
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.040
How does this happen?
With no thought,

90
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.040
no central co-ordination?

91
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.960
How do cells that start off
identical, know to become say, skin,

92
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.720
while others become part of an eye?

93
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.000
Morphogenesis is
a spectacular example

94
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.320
of something called
self-organisation.

95
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.240
And before Turing,
no-one had a clue how it worked.

96
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.840
Then, in 1952,
Turing published this, his paper

97
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.920
with the world's first mathematical
explanation for morphogenesis.

98
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.560
The sheer chutzpah
of this paper was staggering.

99
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.280
In it, Turing used
a mathematical equation

100
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.560
of the kind normally seen in papers
on astronomy or atomic physics,

101
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.680
to describe a living process.

102
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.120
No-one had done anything like this.

103
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.520
Crucially, Turing's equations did,
for the first time,

104
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.640
describe how a biological system
could self-organise.

105
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.080
They showed that something smooth
and featureless can develop features.

106
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.480
One of the astonishing things
about Turing's work

107
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.600
was that
starting with the description

108
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.640
of really very simple processes

109
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.120
governed by very simple equations,
by putting these together,

110
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.640
suddenly complexity emerged.

111
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.160
The pattern suddenly came
out as a natural consequence.

112
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.320
And I think in many ways
this was very, very unexpected.

113
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.360
In essence, Turing's equations
described something quite familiar,

114
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.480
but which no-one had thought of
in the context of biology before.

115
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.800
Think of the way a steady wind
blowing across sand

116
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.800
creates all kinds of shapes.

117
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.360
The grains self-organise
into ripples, waves and dunes.

118
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.560
This happens, even though the
grains are virtually identical,

119
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.920
and have no knowledge of the
shapes they become part of.

120
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.360
Turing argued
that in a very similar way,

121
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.640
chemicals seeping across an embryo

122
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:55.080
might cause its cells to
self-organise into different organs.

123
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.320
These are Turing's own very rough
scribblings of how this might work.

124
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.440
They show how a completely
featureless chemical soup,

125
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.960
can evolve
these strange blobs and patches.

126
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.040
In his paper, he refined his sketches

127
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.040
to show how his equations could
spontaneously create markings

128
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.240
similar to those on
the skins of animals.

129
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.280
Turing went around showing people
pictures saying,

130
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.000
"Doesn't this look
a bit like the patterns on a cow?"

131
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.920
And everyone sort of went,
"What is this man on about?"

132
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.440
But actually,
he knew what he was doing.

133
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.640
They did look like the patterns
of a cow, and that's one of

134
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.760
the reasons why cows have this
dappled pattern or whatever.

135
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.400
So, an area where mathematics
had never been used before,

136
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.720
pattern formation in biology,
animal markings,

137
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.480
suddenly the door was opened
and we could see

138
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.720
that mathematics might be
useful in that sort of area.

139
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.480
So even though Turing's exact
equations are not the full story,

140
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.720
they are the first piece of
mathematical work that showed

141
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.800
there was any possibility
of doing this kind of thing.

142
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.560
Of course, we now know
that morphogenesis

143
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.040
is much more complicated than the
process Turing's equations describe.

144
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:42.280
In fact, the precise mechanism of how
DNA molecules in our cells interact

145
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.760
with other chemicals, is still
fiercely debated by scientists.

146
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.480
But Turing's idea that whatever
is going on is, deep down,

147
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.240
a simple mathematical process,
was truly revolutionary.

148
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.920
I think Alan Turing's paper
is probably the cornerstone

149
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.040
in the whole idea of how
morphogenesis works.

150
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.720
What it does is it provides
us with a mechanism,

151
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.200
something that Darwin didn't,
for how pattern emerges.

152
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.080
Darwin, of course, tells us
that once you have a pattern

153
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.040
and it is coded for in the genes,
that may or may not be passed on,

154
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.000
depending on circumstances.
But what it doesn't do

155
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.120
is explain where that pattern
comes from in the first place.

156
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.680
That's the real mystery.

157
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.160
And so, what Turing had done
was to suddenly provide

158
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.720
an accessible chemical mechanism
for doing this. That was amazing.

159
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.840
Turing was onto a really big,
bold idea.

160
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.680
But sadly, we can only speculate
how his extraordinary mind

161
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.000
would have developed his idea.

162
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.600
Shortly after his groundbreaking
paper on morphogenesis,

163
00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.480
a dreadful and completely
avoidable tragedy destroyed his life.

164
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.360
After his work
breaking codes at Bletchley Park,

165
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.080
you might well have assumed that
Turing would have been honoured

166
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.520
by the country
he did so much to protect.

167
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.360
This couldn't be
further from the truth.

168
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.800
What happened to him after the war
was a great tragedy,

169
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.440
and one of the most shameful episodes
in the history of British science.

170
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.240
The same year Turing
published his morphogenesis paper,

171
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.000
he had a brief affair
with a man called Arnold Murray.

172
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.520
The affair went sour

173
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.840
and Murray was involved in
a burglary at Turing's house.

174
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.440
But when Turing reported
this to the police,

175
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.160
they arrested him as well as Murray.

176
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.800
In court, the prosecution argued

177
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.960
that Turing, with his university
education, had led Murray astray.

178
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.360
He was convicted of gross indecency.

179
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.520
The judge then offered Turing
a dreadful choice.

180
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.080
He could either go to prison,
or sign up to a regime of

181
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.880
female hormone injections
to cure him of his homosexuality.

182
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:22.040
He chose the latter, and it was to
send him into a spiral of depression.

183
00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.280
On 8 June 1954, Turing's
body was found by his cleaner.

184
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.200
He'd died the day before
by taking a bite from an apple

185
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.600
he'd laced with cyanide,
ending his own life.

186
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.840
Alan Turing died aged just 41.

187
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.760
The loss to science is incalculable.

188
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.800
Turing would never know
that his ideas would inspire

189
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.760
an entirely new mathematical
approach to biology,

190
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.400
and that scientists would
find equations like his

191
00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.160
really do explain many of the shapes
that appear on living organisms.

192
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.880
Looking back, we now know
Turing had really grasped the idea

193
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.640
that the wonders of creation are
derived from the simplest of rules.

194
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.280
He had, perhaps unexpectedly,
taken the first step

195
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.440
to a new kind of science.

196
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.520
The next step in the story was
just as unexpected,

197
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.000
and in many ways,
just as tragic as Turing's.

198
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.320
In the early 1950s, around the time
of Turing's seminal paper

199
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.680
on morphogenesis, a brilliant
Russian chemist by the name of

200
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.120
Boris Belousov
was beginning his own investigations

201
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.240
into the chemistry of nature.

202
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:06.160
Deep behind the iron curtain, in a
lab at the Soviet Ministry of Health,

203
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.480
he was beginning to investigate
the way our bodies

204
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.840
extract energy from sugars.

205
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.240
Just like Turing, Belousov was
working on a personal project, having

206
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.040
just finished a distinguished career
as a scientist in the military.

207
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.000
In his lab, Belousov had formulated
a mixture of chemicals

208
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.120
to mimic one part of the process
of glucose absorption in the body.

209
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.000
The mix of chemicals sat on
the lab bench in front of him,

210
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
clear and colourless
while being shaken.

211
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.880
As he mixed in the final chemical,
the whole solution changed colour.

212
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.320
Now this isn't
particularly remarkable.

213
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.440
If we mix ink into water,
it changes colour.

214
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:58.120
But then something happened
that made no sense at all.

215
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.240
The mixture began to go clear again.

216
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.880
Belousov was astounded.

217
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.720
Chemicals can mix together and react.

218
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.360
But they shouldn't be able
to go back on themselves,

219
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.480
to apparently
unmix without intervention.

220
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.560
You can change from a clear
mixture to a coloured mixture, fine.

221
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.960
But surely not back again?

222
00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.000
And it got weirder.

223
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.760
Belousov's chemicals didn't just
spontaneously go into reverse.

224
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.520
They oscillated.

225
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.200
They switched back and forth
from coloured to clear,

226
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:46.440
as if they were being driven by some
sort of hidden chemical metronome.

227
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:52.920
With meticulous care, he repeated
his experiments again and again.

228
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.240
It was the same every time.

229
00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:00.360
His mixture would cycle from clear to
coloured and back again, repeatedly.

230
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.720
He'd discovered something
that was almost like magic,

231
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.920
a physical process that seemed to
violate the laws of nature.

232
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.720
'Convinced he'd discovered something
of great importance, Belousov

233
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:20.400
'wrote up his findings, keen to share
his discovery with the wider world.

234
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.200
'But when he submitted his paper to a
leading Russian scientific journal,

235
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:29.240
'he received a wholly
unexpected and damning response.'

236
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.800
The editor of the journal told
Belousov that his findings in the lab

237
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.000
were quite simply impossible.

238
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.480
They contravened
the fundamental laws of physics.

239
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.040
The only explanation
was that Belousov had made a mistake

240
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.600
in his experiment, and the work
was simply not fit for publication.

241
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.000
'The rejection crushed Belousov.

242
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.160
'Deeply insulted by the suggestion
his work had been botched,

243
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.360
'he abandoned his experiments.

244
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.760
'Soon he gave up science altogether.'

245
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.840
The tragic irony was that, divided
as they were by the Iron Curtain,

246
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.520
Belousov never encountered
Turing's work.

247
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.280
For if he had, he would have
been completely vindicated.

248
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.120
It turns out that Belousov's
oscillating chemicals,

249
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.240
far from contravening
the laws of physics,

250
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.400
were actually a real world example

251
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.920
of precisely the behaviour
Turing's equations predicted.

252
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.560
While the connection might not
appear obvious at first sight,

253
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.800
other scientists showed
that if you left a variation

254
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.240
of Belousov's chemicals,
unstirred in a Petri dish,

255
00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.560
instead of simply oscillating,
they self-organise into shapes.

256
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.920
In fact, they go beyond
Turing's simple blobs and stripes

257
00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.240
to create stunningly
beautiful structures and patterns

258
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.040
out of nowhere.

259
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:26.080
The amazing and very unexpected
thing about the BZ reaction

260
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.680
is that someone
had discovered a system

261
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.080
which essentially reproduces
the Turing equations.

262
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.200
And so, from what looks like
a very, very bland solution

263
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.520
emerge these astonishing patterns
of waves and scrolls and spirals.

264
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.800
Now this is emphatically not
abstract science.

265
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.960
The way Belousov's chemicals
move as co-ordinated waves

266
00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.800
is exactly the way our heart
cells are co-ordinated as they beat.

267
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.720
Animal skins and heart beats.

268
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.880
Self-organisation seems to operate
all over the natural world.

269
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.080
So why were the scientific community
in Turing and Belousov's day,

270
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.520
so uninterested, or even hostile to
this astonishing and beautiful idea?

271
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.200
Well, the reason was all too human.

272
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.480
Mainstream scientists
simply didn't like it.

273
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.760
To them it seemed
to run counter to science,

274
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.040
and all that it had achieved.

275
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.080
To change that view
would require a truly shocking

276
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.280
and completely unexpected
discovery.

277
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.600
In essence, by the beginning
of the 20th century,

278
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.760
scientists saw the universe
as a giant,

279
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.960
complicated, mechanical device.

280
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.360
Kind of a super-sized
version of this orrery.

281
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.520
The idea was that the universe
is a huge and intricate machine

282
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.080
that obeys
orderly mathematical rules.

283
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.840
If you knew the rules of how the
machine was configured to start with,

284
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.120
as you turned the handle,
over and over again,

285
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.640
it would behave
in an entirely predictable way.

286
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.840
Back in the times of Isaac Newton

287
00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.720
when people were discovering
the laws that drove the universe,

288
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.400
they came up with this kind of
metaphor of a clockwork universe.

289
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.000
The universe looked like a machine
which had been set going at the

290
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.040
instant of creation and just
followed the rules and ticked along.

291
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.440
And it was a complicated machine and
therefore complicated things happen.

292
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.680
But once you set it going
it would only do one thing,

293
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.320
and the message
that people drew from this

294
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.880
was that anything describable
by mathematical rules

295
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.360
must actually
basically be fairly simple.

296
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.320
Find the mathematics
that describes a system

297
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.720
and you can then predict
how that system will unfold.

298
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.880
That was the big idea.

299
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.560
It began with Newton's
law of gravity

300
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.920
which can be used to predict
how a planet moves around the sun.

301
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:42.680
Scientists soon found many
other equations just like it.

302
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.280
Newtonian physics seemed
like the ultimate crystal-ball.

303
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.720
It held up
the tantalising possibility

304
00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.600
that the future could,
in principle, be known.

305
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.240
The more careful
your measurements are today,

306
00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.280
the better you can predict
what will happen tomorrow.

307
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.080
But Newtonianism
had a dangerous consequence.

308
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.520
If a nice mathematical system,
that worked in a similar way

309
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:19.400
to my orrery, did sometimes become
unpredictable, scientists assumed

310
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.880
some malign outside force was
causing it. Perhaps dirt had got in?

311
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.800
Perhaps the cogs were wearing out?

312
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.320
Or perhaps someone
had tampered with it?

313
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.440
Basically we used to think,
if you saw very irregular behaviour

314
00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.000
in some problem you're working on,
this must be the result of some sort

315
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.440
of random outside influences,
it couldn't be internally generated.

316
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.720
It wasn't an intrinsic part
of the problem,

317
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.880
it was some other thing
impacting on it.

318
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.560
Looked at from this point of view,

319
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.800
the whole idea of self-organisation
seemed absurd.

320
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.120
The idea that patterns of the kind
Turing and Belousov had found

321
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.840
could appear of their own accord,

322
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.400
without any outside influence,
was a complete taboo.

323
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.400
The only way for self-organisation
to be accepted

324
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:21.040
was for the domineering
Newtonian view to collapse.

325
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.400
But that seemed very unlikely.

326
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.920
After all, by the late '60s
it had delivered

327
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.080
all the wonders of the modern age.

328
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.040
Beautiful, beautiful.

329
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.760
Ain't that something?
Magnificent desolation.

330
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.840
But then, at the same time
as the moon mission,

331
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.120
a small group of scientists,
all ardent Newtonians,

332
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.800
quite unexpectedly
found something wasn't right.

333
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.680
Not right at all.

334
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.760
During the second half
of the 20th century,

335
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.360
a devil was found in the detail.
A devil that would ultimately

336
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:11.520
shatter the Newtonian dream
and plunge us literally into chaos.

337
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:25.720
Ironically, the events that forced
scientists to take self-organisation

338
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:31.160
seriously was the discovery
of a phenomenon known as chaos.

339
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.760
Chaos is one of the most over-used
words in English, but in science

340
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.960
it has a very specific meaning. It
says that a system that is completely

341
00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.040
described by mathematical
equations is more than capable

342
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.680
of being unpredictable without
any outside interference whatsoever.

343
00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.600
There's a widespread misapprehension
that chaos is just somehow saying,

344
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.000
the very familiar fact,
that everything's complicated.

345
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.240
I mean, the nitwit chaoticist
in Jurassic Park,

346
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.080
was under that confusion.

347
00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.480
It's something much simpler and
yet much more complicated than that.

348
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.920
It says, some very, very simple
rules or equations,

349
00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.680
with nothing random in them,
they're completely determined,

350
00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.680
we know everything about the rule,

351
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.560
can have outcomes
that are entirely unpredictable.

352
00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:37.120
Chaos is one of the most
unwelcome discoveries in science.

353
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.560
The man who forced the
scientific community to confront it

354
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.240
was an American meteorologist
called Edward Lorenz.

355
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.760
In the early 1960s he tried
to find mathematical equations

356
00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.640
that could help predict the weather.

357
00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:00.000
Like all his contemporaries,
he believed that in principle

358
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.720
the weather system was no
different to my orrery.

359
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.600
A mechanical system
that could be described

360
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.320
and predicted mathematically.

361
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.760
But he was wrong.

362
00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.640
When Lorenz wrote down what looked
like perfectly simple mathematical

363
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.320
equations to describe the movement 
of air currents,

364
00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.520
they didn't do
what they were supposed to.

365
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.560
They made no useful predictions
whatsoever.

366
00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.400
It was as if the lightest breath
of wind one day could make the

367
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:44.160
difference a month later between a
snowstorm and a perfectly sunny day.

368
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.000
How can a simple system that works
in the regular clockwork manner

369
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.520
of my orrery become unpredictable?

370
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.280
It's all down
to how it's configured.

371
00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.640
How the gears are connected.

372
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.880
In essence,
under certain circumstances,

373
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.160
the tiniest difference in
the starting positions of the cogs,

374
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.480
differences that are too small
to measure,

375
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.240
can get bigger and bigger
with each turn of the handle.

376
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.760
With each step in the process
the system then moves

377
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.920
further and further away
from where you thought it was going.

378
00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:28.600
Lorenz captured this radical idea in 
an influential talk he gave called,

379
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:35.600
"Does a flap of a butterfly's wings
in Brazil set off a tornado
in Texas?"

380
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.760
It was a powerful
and evocative image

381
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.760
and within months a new
phrase had entered our language.

382
00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.600
"The butterfly effect."

383
00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.600
And the butterfly effect,
the hallmark of all chaotic systems,

384
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.960
started turning up everywhere.

385
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.920
In the early '70s, a young
Australian called Robert May,

386
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.720
was investigating a mathematical
equation

387
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:12.000
that modelled how animal
populations changed over time.

388
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.640
But here too lurked
the dreaded butterfly effect.

389
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.720
Immeasurably small changes to the
rates at which the animals reproduced

390
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.400
could sometimes have huge
consequences

391
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.320
on their overall population.

392
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:31.320
Numbers could go up and down wildly
for no obvious reason.

393
00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.800
The idea that a mathematical
equation gave you the power

394
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:41.280
to predict how a system will behave,
was dead.

395
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.560
In some sense this is
the end of the Newtonian dream.

396
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.840
When I was a graduate student,
the belief was,

397
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.320
as we got more and
more computer power,

398
00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:57.960
we'd be able to solve ever more
complicated sets of equations.

399
00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.520
But this said
that's not necessarily true.

400
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.960
You could have the simplest
equations you can think of,

401
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.880
with nothing random in them,
you know everything.

402
00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.480
And yet, if they have behaviour

403
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.840
that gives you chaotic solutions,

404
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.240
then you can never know the
starting point accurately enough.

405
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:29.760
Centuries of scientific certainty
dissolved in just a few short years.

406
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.080
The truth of the clockwork universe
turned out to be just an illusion.

407
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.360
Something which had seemed
a logical certainty,

408
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.560
revealed itself merely
as an act of faith.

409
00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.720
And what's worse, the truth had been
staring us in the face all the time.

410
00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.600
Because chaos is everywhere.

411
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.560
It seemed unpredictability
was hard-wired

412
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.600
into every aspect
of the world we live in.

413
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.120
The global climate
could dramatically change

414
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.000
in the course
of a few short years.

415
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.960
The stock markets
could crash without warning.

416
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.480
We could be wiped from the face of
the planet overnight

417
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.280
and there is nothing
anyone could do about it.

418
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.600
Unfortunately, I have to tell
you that all of this is true.

419
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.960
And yet to be scared of
chaos is pointless.

420
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.320
It's woven into
the basic laws of physics.

421
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.200
And we really all have
to accept it as a fact of life.

422
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.040
The idea of chaos really did have a
big impact over a period of about 20

423
00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.480
or 30 years, because it changed
the way everyone thought about

424
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.200
what they were doing in science.

425
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.520
It changed it to the point

426
00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.400
that they forgot that they'd ever
believed otherwise.

427
00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:02.600
What chaos did was to show us
that the possibilities inherent

428
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.760
in the simple mathematics are much
broader and much more general

429
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.360
than you might imagine.
And so a clockwork universe can

430
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:17.840
nonetheless behave in the rich,
complex way that we experience.

431
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.080
The discovery of chaos

432
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.840
was a real turning point
in the history of science.

433
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.120
As it tore down the Newtonian dream,

434
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.720
scientists began to look more
favourably at Turing and

435
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.720
Belousov's work
on spontaneous pattern formation.

436
00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.680
And perhaps more importantly,
as they did so,

437
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.320
they realised
something truly astonishing.

438
00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.920
That there was a very deep
and unexpected link.

439
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.400
A truly cosmic connection

440
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.200
between nature's strange
power to self-organise

441
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.640
and the chaotic consequences
of the butterfly effect.

442
00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:00.080
Between them,
Turing, Belousov, May and Lorenz,

443
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:05.600
had all discovered different faces
of just one really big idea.

444
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:12.200
They discovered that the natural
world could be deeply,

445
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.600
profoundly, unpredictable. But the
very same things that make it

446
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.560
unpredictable also allow it
to create pattern and structure.

447
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.040
Order and chaos.

448
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.640
It seems the two
are more deeply linked

449
00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.920
than we could have ever imagined.

450
00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.800
So how is this possible?

451
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.880
What do phenomena as apparently
different as the patterns in

452
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.640
Belousov's chemicals
and the weather, have in common?

453
00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.920
First, though both systems
behave in very complicated ways,

454
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.240
they are both based on surprisingly
simple mathematical rules.

455
00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.800
Secondly,
these rules have a unique property.

456
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:05.720
A property that's often referred
to as coupling, or feedback.

457
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.360
To show you what I mean, to show
you both order and chaos can emerge

458
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:20.400
on the their own from a simple system
with feedback, I'm going to do

459
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.240
what seems at first glance
like a rather trivial experiment.

460
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:35.320
This screen behind me is connected
up to the camera that's filming me.

461
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.240
But the camera in turn is filming me
with the screen.

462
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.080
This creates a loop with
multiple copies of me

463
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.200
appearing on the screen.

464
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.760
This is a classic example
of a feedback loop.

465
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.000
We get a picture,
in a picture, in a picture.

466
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.920
At first it seems
fairly predictable.

467
00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.000
But as we zoom the camera in

468
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.680
some pretty strange
things begin to happen.

469
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.800
The first thing I notice
is that the object I'm filming

470
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.200
stops bearing much resemblance
to what now appears on the screen.

471
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:22.800
Small changes in the movement of
the match become rapidly amplified

472
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.120
as they loop round from the camera to
the screen and back to the camera.

473
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:35.440
So even though I can describe each
step in the process mathematically,

474
00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:39.400
I still have no way
of predicting how tiny changes

475
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.840
in the flickering of the flame
will end up in the final image.

476
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.960
This is the butterfly effect
in action.

477
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.400
But now here comes the spooky bit.

478
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.960
With just a slight tweak
to the system,

479
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:09.640
these strange and rather
beautiful patterns begin to emerge.

480
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:16.720
The same system, one that's
based on simple rules with feedback,

481
00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.080
produces chaos and order.

482
00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.720
The same mathematics is generating
chaotic behaviour

483
00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.320
and patterned behaviour.

484
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.040
This changes completely how
you think about all of this.

485
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.960
The idea that there are
regularities in nature and then,

486
00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.320
totally separately from them,

487
00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.680
are irregularities, and these are
just two different things,

488
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.000
is just not true.

489
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.760
These are two ends of a spectrum of
behaviour

490
00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.120
which can be generated
by the same kind of mathematics.

491
00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.120
And it's the closest thing we
have at the moment to the kind
of true mathematics of nature.

492
00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:06.080
I think one of the great take home
messages from Turing's work and from

493
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.120
the discoveries in chemistry
and biology and so on, is that

494
00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.720
ultimately, pattern formation seems
to be woven, very, very deeply

495
00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.840
into the fabric of the universe. And
it actually takes some very simple

496
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.640
and familiar processes,
like diffusion,

497
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.760
like the rates
of chemical reactions,

498
00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.480
and the interplay between them
naturally gives rise to pattern.

499
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.400
So pattern is everywhere,
it's just waiting to happen.

500
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.440
From the '70s on,
more and more scientists

501
00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.440
began to embrace
the concept that chaos

502
00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.080
and pattern are built into
nature's most basic rules.

503
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.680
But one scientist more than any
other brought a fundamentally new

504
00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.320
understanding to this astonishing
and often puzzling idea.

505
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.200
He was a colourful character
and something of a maverick.

506
00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.640
His name is Benoit Mandelbrot.

507
00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.120
Benoit Mandelbrot
wasn't an ordinary child.

508
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.760
He skipped the first
two years of school

509
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.520
and as a Jew in war-torn Europe
his education was very disrupted.

510
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.560
He was largely self-taught
or tutored by relatives.

511
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.240
He never formally learned
the alphabet,

512
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.880
or even multiplication
beyond the five times table.

513
00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.280
But, like Alan Turing,

514
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.120
Mandelbrot had a gift for seeing
nature's hidden patterns.

515
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.320
He could see rules where
the rest of us see anarchy.

516
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.480
He could see form and structure,

517
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.640
where the rest of us just
see a shapeless mess.

518
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.160
And above all, he could see that
a strange new kind of mathematics

519
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.560
underpinned the whole of nature.

520
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:57.800
Mandelbrot's lifelong quest was
to find a simple mathematical basis

521
00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:02.720
for the rough and irregular
shapes of the real world.

522
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.320
Mandelbrot was working for IBM

523
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.600
and he was not in the normal
academic environment.

524
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.360
And he was working on
a pile of different problems

525
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.400
about irregularities in nature,
in the financial markets,

526
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.760
all over the place.

527
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.720
And I think at some point it
dawned on him that everything

528
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.520
he was doing seen to be really
parts of the same big picture.

529
00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.960
And he was a sufficiently
original and unusual person that

530
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.320
he realised that pursuing
this big picture was what

531
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.960
he really wanted to do. To
Mandelbrot, it seemed perverse that

532
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.680
mathematicians had spent centuries
contemplating idealised shapes

533
00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.480
like straight lines
or perfect circles.

534
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.560
And yet had no proper or systematic
way of describing the rough

535
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.720
and imperfect shapes
that dominate the real world.

536
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.240
Take this pebble.

537
00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.040
Is it a sphere or a cube?

538
00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.280
Or maybe a bit of both?

539
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:08.520
And what about something much
bigger? Look at the arch behind me.

540
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.640
From a distance,
it looks like a semi-circle.

541
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.840
But up close,
we see that it's bent and crooked.

542
00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.360
So what shape is it?

543
00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.920
Mandelbrot asked if
there's something unique

544
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.040
that defines all
the varied shapes in nature.

545
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.800
Do the fluffy surfaces of clouds,
the branches in trees and rivers,

546
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:39.760
the crinkled edges of shorelines,
share a common mathematical feature?

547
00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.600
Well, they do.

548
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.320
Underlying nearly all the shapes in
the natural world is a mathematical

549
00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:53.320
principle known as self-similarity.
This describes anything in which the

550
00:41:53.320 --> 00:42:00.480
same shape is repeated over and over
again at smaller and smaller scales.

551
00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.920
A great example are
the branches of trees.

552
00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.680
They fork and fork again,
repeating that simple process

553
00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:13.440
over and over
at smaller and smaller scales.

554
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:19.640
The same branching principle applies
in the structure of our lungs

555
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.320
and the way our blood vessels are
distributed throughout our bodies.

556
00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:30.160
It even describes how rivers
split into ever smaller streams.

557
00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.800
And nature can repeat
all sorts of shapes in this way.

558
00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.560
Look at this Romanesco broccoli.

559
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.920
Its overall structure is made up
of a series of repeating cones

560
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:46.320
at smaller and smaller scales.

561
00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.920
Mandelbrot realised self-similarity

562
00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.760
was the basis of an entirely
new kind of geometry.

563
00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.440
And he even gave it a name -
fractal.

564
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.000
Now, that's a pretty neat
observation.

565
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.800
But what if you could represent this
property of nature in mathematics?

566
00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:11.040
What if you could capture
its essence to draw a picture?

567
00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.280
What would that picture look like?

568
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.200
Could you use a simple set
of mathematical rules

569
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.760
to draw an image
that didn't look man-made?

570
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.520
The answer
would come from Mandelbrot.

571
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.560
Who had taken a job at IBM
in the late 1950s

572
00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.320
to gain access to
its incredible computing power

573
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:35.240
and pursue his obsession
with the mathematics of nature.

574
00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.720
Armed with a new
breed of super-computer,

575
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.080
he began investigating
a rather curious

576
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.920
and strangely simple-looking equation

577
00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.800
that could be used to draw
a very unusual shape.

578
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.560
What I'm about to show you
is one of the most remarkable

579
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:59.440
mathematical images ever discovered.
Epic doesn't really do it justice.

580
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.040
This is the Mandelbrot set.

581
00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.000
It's been called
the thumbprint of God.

582
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.040
And when we begin to explore
it, you'll understand why.

583
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.280
Just as with the tree
or the broccoli,

584
00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:25.520
the closer you study this picture,
the more detail you see.

585
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.280
Each shape within the set

586
00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.400
contains an infinite number
of smaller shapes.

587
00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.560
Baby Mandelbrots
that go on for ever.

588
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:48.360
Yet all this complexity stems from
just one incredibly simple equation.

589
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:53.000
This equation has
a very important property.

590
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.160
It feeds back on itself.

591
00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:02.000
Like a video loop, each output
becomes the input for the next go.

592
00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.600
This feedback means that an
incredibly simple mathematical

593
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:14.760
equation can produce a picture
of infinite complexity.

594
00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.320
The really fascinating thing

595
00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:38.160
is that the Mandelbrot set isn't
just a bizarre mathematical quirk.

596
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.480
Its fractal property
of being similar at all scales

597
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.760
mirrors a fundamental
ordering principle in nature.

598
00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:57.040
Turing's patterns, Belousov's
reaction and Mandelbrot's fractals

599
00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:02.240
are all signposts pointing to a deep
underlying natural principle.

600
00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.880
When we look at complexities
in nature, we tend to ask,

601
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.760
"Where did they come from?"

602
00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.160
There is something
in our heads that says

603
00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.880
complexity does not arise
out of simplicity.

604
00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.880
It must arise from something
complicated. We conserve complexity.

605
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.840
But what the mathematics in
this whole area is telling us

606
00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.120
is that very simple rules naturally
give rise to very complex objects.

607
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.800
And so if you look at the object, it
looks complex, and you think about

608
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.960
the rule that generates it,
it's simple.

609
00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.400
So the same thing is both
complex and simple

610
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.960
from two different points of view.
And that means we have to rethink

611
00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.960
completely the relation between
simplicity and complexity.

612
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:50.200
Complex systems
can be based on simple rules.

613
00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.480
That's the big revelation.

614
00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.240
And it's an astonishing idea.

615
00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.640
It seems to apply
all over our world.

616
00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:15.840
Look at a flock of birds.
Each bird obeys very simple rules.

617
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.920
But the flock as a whole does
incredibly complicated things.

618
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:25.520
Avoiding obstacles, navigating
the planet with no single leader

619
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:31.640
or even conscious plan. But amazing
though this flock's behaviour is,

620
00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.800
it's impossible
to predict how it will behave.

621
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.240
It never repeats
exactly what it does,

622
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:42.560
even in seemingly
identical circumstances.

623
00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.160
It's just like
the Belousov reaction.

624
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:53.280
Each time you run it, the patterns
produced are slightly different.

625
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.520
They may look similar,
but they are never identical.

626
00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:01.680
The same is true of
video loops and sand dunes.

627
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.280
We know they'll produce
a certain kind of pattern,

628
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.880
but we can't predict
the exact shapes.

629
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:17.200
The big question is, can nature's
ability to turn simplicity

630
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.960
into complexity in this mysterious
and unpredictable way

631
00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.520
explain why life exists?

632
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:29.760
Can it explain how a universe
full of simple dust

633
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.200
can turn into human beings?

634
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.320
How inanimate matter
can spawn intelligence?

635
00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:43.480
At first, you might think that
this is beyond the remit of science.

636
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.680
If nature's rules are
really unpredictable,

637
00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.560
should we simply give up?

638
00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.680
Absolutely not.
In fact, quite the opposite.

639
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.760
Fittingly, the answer to this problem
lies in the natural world.

640
00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:03.160
All around us, there exists
a process that engineers

641
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.880
these unpredictable complex systems

642
00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:10.320
and hones them to perform
almost miraculous tasks.

643
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.320
The process is called evolution.

644
00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.440
Evolution has built
on these patterns.

645
00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.960
It's taken them as
the raw ingredients.

646
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.280
It's combined them together
in various ways,

647
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:29.840
experimented to see what works
and what doesn't,

648
00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:34.200
kept the things that do work
and then built on that.

649
00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.360
It's a completely
unconscious process,

650
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.520
but basically
that's what's happening.

651
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.880
Everywhere you look,
you can see evolution

652
00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:45.360
using nature's
self-organising patterns.

653
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:50.720
Our hearts use Belousov-type
reactions to regulate how they beat.

654
00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.400
Our blood vessels are
organised like fractals.

655
00:49:54.400 --> 00:50:00.640
Even our brain cells
interact according to simple rules.

656
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:05.080
The way evolution refines
and enriches complex systems

657
00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:09.000
is one of the most intriguing
ideas in recent science.

658
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.640
My interest in my PhD research
in complex systems was to see

659
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:18.720
how complex systems
interact with evolution.

660
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.640
So, on the one hand you have systems
that almost organise themselves

661
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:26.200
as complex systems, so they exhibit
order that you wouldn't expect,

662
00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:30.360
but on the other hand, you still
have to have evolution interact with

663
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:33.960
that to create something that is
truly adapted to the environment.

664
00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:38.200
Evolution's mindless, yet creative,
power to develop

665
00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.560
and shape complex systems
is indeed incredible.

666
00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.920
But it operates on
a cosmic timescale.

667
00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.440
From the first life on
Earth, to us walking about,

668
00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.200
took in the region of
3.5 billion years.

669
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.080
But we now have in our hands

670
00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:04.120
a device that can mimic this process
on a much shorter timescale.

671
00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:08.040
What is the invention
I'm talking about?

672
00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.400
Well, there's a good chance you've
been sitting in front of one all day.

673
00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.480
It is, of course, the computer.

674
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:27.320
Computers today can churn through
trillions of calculations per second.

675
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.720
And that gives them the power
to do something very special.

676
00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.600
They can simulate evolution.

677
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.400
More precisely, computers can use
the principles of evolution to shape

678
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.600
and refine their own programs, 
in the same way the natural world

679
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:49.920
uses evolution to shape
and refine living organisms.

680
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:55.000
And today, computer scientists
find that this evolved software

681
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.680
can solve problems that would
be beyond the smartest of humans.

682
00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:04.240
One thing that we found particularly
in our original research is how

683
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:08.720
powerful evolution is as a system,
as an algorithm, to create something

684
00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:12.320
that is very complex and to create
something that is very adaptive.

685
00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:16.080
Torsten and his team's goal
was nothing less

686
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.760
than to use computerised evolution

687
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:23.520
to create a virtual brain
that would control a virtual body.

688
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:29.000
To begin with,
they created 100 random brains.

689
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.480
As you can see,
they weren't up to much.

690
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.920
Evolution then took over.

691
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:40.400
The computer selected the brains
that were slightly better

692
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.760
at moving their bodies
and got them to breed.

693
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:49.160
The algorithm then takes those
individuals that do the best

694
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.720
and it allows them
to create offspring.

695
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.400
The best movers
of the next generation

696
00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.840
were then bred
together and so on and on.

697
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.840
Amazingly,
after just 10 generations,

698
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:08.040
although they're still a bit
unsteady, the figures could walk.

699
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.600
Eventually, miraculously,
you actually end up

700
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.840
with something that works.
The slightly scary thing

701
00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:17.240
is you don't know why it
works and how it works.

702
00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.680
You look at that brain and you have
no idea actually what's going on

703
00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.640
because evolution has
optimised it automatically.

704
00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:31.280
In 20 generations,
evolution had turned this...

705
00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.200
..into this.

706
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:41.840
But these evolved computer beings
soon went far beyond just walking.

707
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.200
They evolved to do things

708
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.760
that really are impossible
to program conventionally.

709
00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:57.560
They react realistically
to unexpected events.

710
00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:00.280
Like being hit or falling over.

711
00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:07.840
Even though we programmed these
algorithms, what actually happens

712
00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.320
when it unfolds live,
we don't control any more

713
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.560
and things happen
that we never expected.

714
00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.120
And it's quite a funny feeling

715
00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:18.000
that you create these algorithms
but then they do their own thing.

716
00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:28.520
An unthinking process of
evolutionary trial and error

717
00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:34.840
has created these virtual creatures
that can move and react in real time.

718
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:43.240
What we're seeing here
is fantastic experimental evidence

719
00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:47.720
for the creative power of systems
based on simple rules.

720
00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:02.520
Watching how computers can
unconsciously evolve programs

721
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.840
to do things that no human
could consciously program

722
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:11.680
is a fantastic example
of the power of self-organisation.

723
00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.720
It demonstrates that
evolution is itself

724
00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.200
just like the other
systems we've encountered.

725
00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.720
One based on simple
rules and feedback.

726
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:25.280
From which complexity
spontaneously emerges.

727
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:30.960
Think about it. The simple rule
is that the organism

728
00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:36.000
must replicate with a few
random mutations now and again.

729
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.720
The feedback
comes from the environment

730
00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:43.520
which favours the mutations
that are best suited to it.

731
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:47.680
The result is
ever-increasing complexity,

732
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.280
produced without thought or design.

733
00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.840
The interesting thing
is that one can move up

734
00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.920
to a higher level of organisation.
Once you have organisms

735
00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.840
that actually have patterns on them,
these can be selected for

736
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:07.720
or selected against by processes
which are essentially feedbacks.

737
00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.280
And so evolution itself,
the whole Darwinian scheme,

738
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.440
is, in a sense, Turing again

739
00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.760
with feedbacks happening
through different processes.

740
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.560
And that's the essence of this story.

741
00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:26.080
Unthinking, simple rules
have the power to create

742
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:30.560
amazingly complex systems
without any conscious thought.

743
00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:36.760
In that sense, these computer beings
are self-organised systems,

744
00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:41.040
just like the one Belousov
observed happening in his chemicals.

745
00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:46.640
Just like the ones in sand dunes
and the Mandelbrot sets,

746
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:51.040
in our lungs, our hearts, in weather

747
00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.520
and in the geography
of our planet.

748
00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.920
Design does not need
an active, interfering designer.

749
00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.920
It's an inherent part
of the universe.

750
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:10.280
One of the things that makes people
so uncomfortable about this idea of,

751
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:15.000
if you will, spontaneous pattern
formation, is that somehow or other

752
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.760
you don't need a creator. But
perhaps a really clever designer,

753
00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.640
what he would do,
is to kind of treat the universe

754
00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:26.800
like a giant simulation,
where you set some initial condition

755
00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.000
and just let the whole thing
spontaneously happen

756
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.600
in all of its wonder
and all of its beauty.

757
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000
The mathematics of pattern formation
shows that the same kind of pattern

758
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.680
can show up in an enormous range
of different physical,

759
00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:46.320
chemical, biological systems.
Somewhere deep down inside,

760
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:49.480
it's happening
for the same mathematical reason.

761
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:53.400
Implicit in those facts
are these beautiful patterns

762
00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.200
that we see everywhere.

763
00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:58.960
This, I think,
is a mind-blowing thought.

764
00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:12.080
So, what is the ultimate
lesson we can take from all this?

765
00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:15.840
Well, it's that
all the complexity of the universe,

766
00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:18.160
all its infinite richness,

767
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:23.960
emerges from mindless simple rules,
repeated over and over again.

768
00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:27.400
But remember,
powerful though this process is,

769
00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.520
it's also inherently unpredictable.

770
00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:36.080
So although I can confidently tell
you that the future will be amazing,

771
00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:40.000
I can also say,
with scientific certainty,

772
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.520
that I have no idea what it holds.
